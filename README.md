# To Do App

## Phase 1 Requirements

In Phase 1, we're going to perform some refactoring of the To Do application as built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

    Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}

    Properly modularize the application into separate components

    Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
        How many To Do Items to show at once
        Whether or not to show completed items

## Phase 2 Requirements

In Phase 2, we're going to extend the functionality of our application by allowing the user to make some decisions on how they would like the application to function. Specifically, we'll let them make changes to 2 settings.

    Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
        How many To Do Items to show at once
        Whether or not to show completed items
    Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings
        This should be given in the form of a new component, perhaps linked to from the main navigation
        Hint: Use Browser Router to create the page/route/component for this
    Save the users choices in Local Storage
    Retrieve their preferences from Local Storage and apply them to the application on startup


## Phase 3 Requirements

In Phase 3, we'd like to extend the functionality of the application by requiring users be logged in to view items and also restrict access based on user type. The user stories from Phases 1, and 2 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories.

    As a user, I want to provide a way for other users to create new accounts
    As a user, I want to provide a way for all users to login to their account
    As a user, I want to make sure that my To Do items are only viewable to users that have logged in with a valid account.
    As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to "create", based on their user type, can add new To Do Items
    As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to "update", based on their user type, can mark To Do Items complete
    As a user, I want to ensure that only fellow users that are allowed to "delete", based on their user type, can delete new To Do Items


## Phase 4 Requirements

Technical requirements for the core application are unchanged from the prior phases, with the following additions and notes:

    Alter the Add, Toggle Complete, and Delete functions within your to do application to use your API instead of in memory state
        Fetch the current list of items from the database on application start
        Whenever you add/update/delete an item, refresh the state so the user can instantly see the change
            Consider: Do you re-fetch from the server every time you make a change?
                If so, how?
                If not, how will you stay in sync?

    Alter the Login Context to use the server to login users instead of our mock users list
        Be sure to store the token in state as well as in a cookie so you can reference it later
